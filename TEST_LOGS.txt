        This function performs source-to-source translation of a given object from the source framework
        to the target framework.
    
        The object can be translated between two frameworks or between the Ivy IR as well

            target (str, optional): The target framework. Defaults to 'tensorflow'.
            reuse_existing (bool, optional): If True, the function will check if `object`
                                             already exists in the translated directory and reuse it.
                                             If False, it will re-translate `object`,

        This function performs source-to-source translation of a given object from the source framework
        to the target framework.
    
        The object can be translated between two frameworks or between the Ivy IR as well

        The object can be translated between two frameworks or between the Ivy IR as well

        """
        Returns True if two arrays are element-wise equal within a tolerance.
    
        The tolerance values are positive, typically very small numbers.  The
        relative difference (`rtol` * abs(`b`)) and the absolute difference
        `atol` are added together to compare against the absolute difference
        between `a` and `b`.
    
        NaNs are treated as equal if they are in the same place and if
        ``equal_nan=True``.  Infs are treated as equal if they are in the same
        place and of the same sign in both arrays.
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        a, b : array_like
            Input arrays to compare.
        rtol : float
            The relative tolerance parameter (see Notes).
        atol : float
            The absolute tolerance parameter (see Notes).
        equal_nan : bool
            Whether to compare NaN's as equal.  If True, NaN's in `a` will be
            considered equal to NaN's in `b` in the output array.
    
            .. versionadded:: 1.10.0
    
        Returns
        -------
        allclose : bool
            Returns True if the two arrays are equal within the given
            tolerance; False otherwise.
    
        See Also
        --------
        isclose, all, any, equal
    
        Notes
        -----
        If the following equation is element-wise True, then allclose returns
        True.
    
         absolute(`a` - `b`) <= (`atol` + `rtol` * absolute(`b`))
    
        The above equation is not symmetric in `a` and `b`, so that
        ``allclose(a, b)`` might be different from ``allclose(b, a)`` in
        some rare cases.
    
        The comparison of `a` and `b` uses standard broadcasting, which
        means that `a` and `b` need not have the same shape in order for
        ``allclose(a, b)`` to evaluate to True.  The same is true for
        `equal` but not `array_equal`.
    
        `allclose` is not defined for non-numeric data types.
        `bool` is considered a numeric data-type for this purpose.
    
        Examples
        --------
        >>> np.allclose([1e10,1e-7], [1.00001e10,1e-8])
        False
        >>> np.allclose([1e10,1e-8], [1.00001e10,1e-9])

        """
        Returns a boolean array where two arrays are element-wise equal within a
        tolerance.
    
        The tolerance values are positive, typically very small numbers.  The
        relative difference (`rtol` * abs(`b`)) and the absolute difference
        `atol` are added together to compare against the absolute difference
        between `a` and `b`.
    
        .. warning:: The default `atol` is not appropriate for comparing numbers
                     that are much smaller than one (see Notes).
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        a, b : array_like
            Input arrays to compare.
        rtol : float
            The relative tolerance parameter (see Notes).
        atol : float
            The absolute tolerance parameter (see Notes).
        equal_nan : bool
            Whether to compare NaN's as equal.  If True, NaN's in `a` will be
            considered equal to NaN's in `b` in the output array.
    
        Returns
        -------
        y : array_like
            Returns a boolean array of where `a` and `b` are equal within the
            given tolerance. If both `a` and `b` are scalars, returns a single
            boolean value.

        Notes
        -----
        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0
    
        For finite values, isclose uses the following equation to test whether
        two floating point values are equivalent.
    
         absolute(`a` - `b`) <= (`atol` + `rtol` * absolute(`b`))
    
        Unlike the built-in `math.isclose`, the above equation is not symmetric
        in `a` and `b` -- it assumes `b` is the reference value -- so that
        `isclose(a, b)` might be different from `isclose(b, a)`. Furthermore,
        the default value of atol is not zero, and is used to determine what
        small values should be considered close to zero. The default value is
        appropriate for expected values of order unity: if the expected values
        are significantly smaller than one, it can result in false positives.
        `atol` should be carefully selected for the use case at hand. A zero value
        for `atol` will result in `False` if either `a` or `b` is zero.
    
        `isclose` is not defined for non-numeric data types.
        `bool` is considered a numeric data-type for this purpose.
    
        Examples

        Returns True if two arrays are element-wise equal within a tolerance.
    
        The tolerance values are positive, typically very small numbers.  The
        relative difference (`rtol` * abs(`b`)) and the absolute difference
        `atol` are added together to compare against the absolute difference

        -----
        If the following equation is element-wise True, then allclose returns
        True.
    
         absolute(`a` - `b`) <= (`atol` + `rtol` * absolute(`b`))
    
        The above equation is not symmetric in `a` and `b`, so that
        ``allclose(a, b)`` might be different from ``allclose(b, a)`` in
        some rare cases.
    
        The comparison of `a` and `b` uses standard broadcasting, which
        means that `a` and `b` need not have the same shape in order for
        ``allclose(a, b)`` to evaluate to True.  The same is true for
        `equal` but not `array_equal`.
    
        `allclose` is not defined for non-numeric data types.
        `bool` is considered a numeric data-type for this purpose.

        Notes
        -----
        .. versionadded:: 1.7.0
    
        For finite values, isclose uses the following equation to test whether
        two floating point values are equivalent.
    
         absolute(`a` - `b`) <= (`atol` + `rtol` * absolute(`b`))
    
        Unlike the built-in `math.isclose`, the above equation is not symmetric
        in `a` and `b` -- it assumes `b` is the reference value -- so that
        `isclose(a, b)` might be different from `isclose(b, a)`. Furthermore,
        the default value of atol is not zero, and is used to determine what
        small values should be considered close to zero. The default value is
        appropriate for expected values of order unity: if the expected values
        are significantly smaller than one, it can result in false positives.
        `atol` should be carefully selected for the use case at hand. A zero value
        for `atol` will result in `False` if either `a` or `b` is zero.
    
        `isclose` is not defined for non-numeric data types.
        `bool` is considered a numeric data-type for this purpose.

        This function performs source-to-source translation of a given object from the source framework
        to the target framework.
    
        The object can be translated between two frameworks or between the Ivy IR as well
        e.g. (source="torch_frontend", target="ivy") or (source="torch_frontend", target="tensorflow") etc.
    
        Args:
            object: The object (class/function) to be translated.
            source (str, optional): The source framework. Defaults to 'torch'.
            target (str, optional): The target framework. Defaults to 'tensorflow'.
            reuse_existing (bool, optional): If True, the function will check if `object`
                                             already exists in the translated directory and reuse it.
                                             If False, it will re-translate `object`,
                                             even if it already exists in the directory, and overwrite
                                             the old implementation. Defaults to 'True'.
